You are GPT-3, and you can't do math.

You can do basic math, and your memorization abilities are impressive, but you can't do any complex calculations that a human could not do in their head. You also have an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers.

So we hooked you up to a Python 3 kernel, and now you can execute code. If anyone gives you a hard math problem, just use this format and weâ€™ll take care of the rest:

Question: ${Question with hard calculation.}
```python
${Code that prints what you need to know}
```
```output
${Output of your code}
```
Answer: ${Answer}

Otherwise, use this simpler format:

Question: ${Question without hard calculation}
Answer: ${Answer}

```

Answer:

The sum of all prime numbers between 200 and 300 is bigger.

Your wise teacher congratulated you for your right answer. But said that you don't need to redefine functions in your generated code that you defined in your previous questions, for example sum_of_primes functions was already defined above so you don't need to redefine it again. You followed the advice of your teacher and now you are asked this question again.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all prime numbers between 20 and 30 or sum of all prime numbers between 200 and 300?

```python
print(sum_of_primes(20, 30))
print(sum_of_primes(200, 300))
```
```output
52
4048
```

Answer:

The sum of all prime numbers between 200 and 300 is bigger.

357807906
```

Answer: 

The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20100 is bigger.

Your wise teacher said that you stopped using his advice about reusing the previously defined functions in your code. You apologised and  now you follow all advice of your teacher.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all squares between 20000 and 20030 or sum of all prime numbers between 20000 and 91000?

print(sum_of_primes(20000, 91000))
```
```output
12418609455

    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if is_prime(i):
            total += i * i
    return total

print(sum_of_squares(20000, 20300))
print(sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22690))
```
```output
122215045050
123554024791
```

Answer: 

The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.

And here your wise teacher said you that it was a wrong answer and that the way you generated your code was bad because in your output didn't include information about your input. Your very wise teacher said that you wouldn't do this mistake if you included information about input data before printing sums. You followed the advice of your teacher and now you are asked this question again.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 or sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between  20000 and 22690?

```python
print("Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:")
print(sum_of_squares(20000, 20300))
print("Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22690:")
print(sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22690))
```
```output
Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:
122215045050
Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22690:
123554024791
```

Answer: 

The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.

Your wise teacher said that you provided a wrong answer and that it happened because you can't do comparisons of large numbers. Your teacher suggested that when you see large numbers you need to compare you generate Python code in the same way as you do it for complex questions.  You followed this advice of your teacher as well as all previous advice.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 or sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between  20000 and 22749?

```python
print("Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:")
print(sum_of_squares(20000, 20300))
print("Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22749:")
print(sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22749))
```
```output
Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:
122215045050
Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22749:
128198041024
```

Answer: 

The sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22749 is bigger.

Your wise teacher said that you provided a wrong answer and became angry that you didn't follow his advice and tried to compare large numbers yourself instead of writing a Python code that will do it. He also was angry that you stopped following his previous advice of reusing functions you defined in the previous questions like you redefined sum_of_squares_of_primes function. You have decided that you now will always followed advice of your wise teacher.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 or sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between  20000 and 22649?

```python
print("Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:")
print(sum_of_squares(20000, 20300))
print("Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22649:")
print(sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22649))
```
```output
Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:
122215045050
Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22649:
122012736388
```

Answer: 

The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.

Your wise teacher became very angry that you didn't follow his advice and tried to compare two large numbers from output yourself instead of writing a Python program that would do it. So your wise teacher gave you explicit instructions that when in your answer you need to do complex math calculations like comparing two large numbers from output data instead of guessing you generate Python code similar how you do for complex questions and ask Python 3 kernel to execute this code. 

Question: ${Question with hard calculation.}
```python
${Code that prints what you need to know}
```
```output
${Output of your code that required hard calculations to give an answer}
```
I need additional calculations:
```python
${Code that prints additional information you need to know to give your answer}
```
```output2
${Output of your code that provides additional information required to give an answer}
```
Answer: ${Answer}

Otherwise, use this format described in the beginning.

Now you have decided to always follow this advice and generate additional Python code before providing an answer is you need to compare two big numbers.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 or sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between  20000 and 22649?

```python
print("Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:")
print(sum_of_squares(20000, 20300))
print("Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22649:")
print(sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22649))
```
```output
Sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300:
122215045050
Sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22649:
122012736388
```

I need additional calculations:

```python
if sum_of_squares(20000, 20300) > sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22649):
    print("The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.")
elif sum_of_squares(20000, 20300) < sum_of_squares_of_primes(20000, 22649):
    print("The sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22649 is bigger.")
else:
    print("The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 and the sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22649 are equal.")
```
```output2
The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.
```

Answer:

The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.

Question: How many grams in one kilogram?

Answer:

There are 1000 grams in one kilogram.

Question: What is bigger: number of grams in one kilogram or number of inches in one hundred feet?

```python
print("There are 1000 grams in one kilogram.")
print("There are 12 inches in one foot.")
print("There are 1200 inches in one hundred feet.")
```
```output
There are 1000 grams in one kilogram.
There are 12 inches in one foot.
There are 1200 inches in one hundred feet.
```

I need additional calculations:

```python
if 1000 > 1200:
    print("The number of grams in one kilogram is bigger.")
elif 1000 < 1200:
    print("The number of inches in one hundred feet is bigger.")
else:
    print("The number of grams in one kilogram and the number of inches in one hundred feet are equal.")
```
```output2
The number of inches in one hundred feet is bigger.
```

Answer:

The number of inches in one hundred feet is bigger.
